Given an array of size n such that array elements are in range from
1 to n. The task is to count a number of move-to-front
operations to arrange items as {1, 2, 3,â€¦ n}. The move-to-front operation
is to pick any item and place it in first position.

This problem can also be seen as a stack of items with only move available
is to pull an item from the stack and placing it on top of the stack.

Examples :

Input: arr[] = {3, 2, 1, 4}.
Output: 2
First, we pull out 2 and places it on top,
so the array becomes (2, 3, 1, 4). After that,
pull out 1 and becomes (1, 2, 3, 4).

Input:  arr[] = {5, 7, 4, 3, 2, 6, 1}
Output:  6
We pull elements in following order
7, 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2

Input: arr[] = {4, 3, 2, 1}.
Output: 3
